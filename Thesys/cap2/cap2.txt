Background on Patch
Management
Cybersecurity focuses on protecting assets from intentional actions that could
compromise their integrity, availability or confidentiality. These assets have intrinsic
value that makes protecting them necessary. However, they may be exposed to
malicious activity due to vulnerabilities, i.e. weaknesses in the systems that manage
them or even in the mechanisms that are supposed to protect them.
Such vulnerabilities can be exploited by adversaries, who pose a threat to the
system. Threats play a key role in determining security risk, which depends not
only on the presence of threats and vulnerabilities, but also on the value of the asset
involved. An increase in the number or severity of threats leads to a proportional
increase in risk, which is further influenced by the specific nature of the threat
itself.
To mitigate these risks, security controls are introduced. Security controls are
measures designed to protect systems by preventing, detecting or responding to
threats. Their implementation reduces security risk and helps to meet security
requirements, which define the acceptable level of residual risk based on the risks
that have been identified.
As previously announced, a software vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in the
code, design, implementation or configuration of the system in question that can
be exploited by an attacker to compromise its security. The National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) formally defines a vulnerability as ‘a weakness
in an information system, security procedures, internal controls, or implementation
that could be exploited by a threat source’ (NIST, 2012).
It is therefore important to distinguish between vulnerability and weakness. A
vulnerability refers to a specific instance of a flaw in a system, such as a particular
version of software affected by a known flaw. A weakness, on the other hand, is

a broader concept that describes a general class of security issues, such as buffer
overflows. In this sense, a vulnerability is an instance of a weakness and can be
exploited through an exploit, typically a script or programme designed to take
advantage of the flaw. Vulnerabilities can be introduced at different stages of the
software lifecycle:
• Design phase: when software is developed based on inaccurate or incomplete
specifications, or when specifications are not translated correctly.
• Implementation phase: when programming errors or bugs are introduced
into the source code.
• Configuration phase: when the chosen system configurations compromise
its security.
• Third-party libraries: when external components introduce vulnerabilities
beyond the developer’s direct control.
It is important to note that a weakness is not necessarily a bug. For example,
storing passwords in plain text is not a functional error; the system may still
function as intended, but it represents a serious vulnerability due to inadequate
or non-existent security requirements. Ultimately, vulnerabilities are dangerous
because they allow attackers to compromise the security of the system. If a flaw
cannot be exploited, it is not considered a vulnerability.
The lifecycle of a vulnerability includes several key stages:
1. Creation: The vulnerability is introduced during the design, implementation,
or operation of the system.
2. Discovery: The vulnerability remains unknown until it is identified by a
researcher, attacker, or developer.
3. Disclosure: Information about the vulnerability is communicated to the
vendor or made public.
4. Exploit development: An exploit is developed to take advantage of the
vulnerability.
5. Patch creation: A patch is developed to fix the vulnerability.
6. Closure: The vulnerability is mitigated once the patch has been widely
distributed.
During this lifecycle, several scenarios can occur. In the best-case scenario, deve-
lopers discover the vulnerability before any type of exploit is produced, allowing
4

for the proactive development and release of a patch. In the most critical case,
a hypothetical attacker discovers the vulnerability first and develops an exploit
before the defenders are aware of it, resulting in a zero-day vulnerability that leaves
security teams with no time to react.
Disclosure refers to the process by which information about a vulnerability is shared.
Three main disclosure models are commonly adopted:
• Responsible disclosure: A researcher privately informs the vendor of a
system and allows a set period of time for patch development before public
disclosure. Necessary even in the absence of a patch.
• Full disclosure: Details of the vulnerability are immediately made public.
• Coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD): A structured approach
involving researchers, vendors, and coordinating bodies such as CERT/CC.
Disclosure triggers a race against time: vendors must quickly develop and distribute
patches, while attackers simultaneously work on developing an exploit. This
dynamic puts significant pressure on organisations, which must apply patches
before exploits spread (Dissanayake et al., 2021b).
Information about vulnerabilities is collected in specialised repositories, which can
be divided into two broad categories as follows:
• Public repositories (freely accessible):
– MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
– NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which enriches CVE entries
with additional metadata
• Private repositories (subscription based):
– Exodus Intelligence
– Zerodium
MITRE also manages the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) repository,
which provides a standardised taxonomy for classifying software vulnerabilities.
The NVD also introduces important metrics such as the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS), which assesses vulnerabilities based on multiple factors,
including Access Vector (the level of access required to exploit the vulnerability)
and Access Complexity (the difficulty associated with exploitation).

2.1 Security Patches
Software security patches are defined as “pieces of code developed to address
security issues identified in software” (Mell et al., 2005). Unlike functional patches,
which introduce new features or fix non security related bugs, security patches are
specifically designed to eliminate or mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited
by malicious actors.
Security patches are always prioritized by industry professionals, as they aim to
address vulnerabilities that present exploitable opportunities for malicious entities
(Mell et al., 2005; Brykczynski & Small, 2003). However, applying them is not
a trivial task: it may require system reboots, introduce incompatibilities with
existing software, alter the behavior of critical applications, and, in extreme cases,
even cause malfunctions due to defects in the patch itself.
Li and Paxson (2017), in a large scale empirical study, analyzed the characteristics
of security patches and found significant variation in terms of complexity, size,
and type of changes. Some patches consist of simple code updates, while others
require substantial restructuring. While some patches only require the installation
of updated code, others may involve changes to system registries, the installation
of preparatory packages, or specific configurations.
A critical concept in this context is the “window of exposure,” which refers to the
period during which a system remains vulnerable to attack. This window begins
when the vulnerability becomes exploitable and ends when the patch is applied.
Marconato et al. (2013) proposed a security model illustrating how reducing this
window is the primary goal of Security Patch Management, and how any delay at
any stage of the patching process extends the period of risk.
Despite timely patch releases from vendors, the majority of real world cyberattacks
exploit known vulnerabilities for which patches were already available (Dissanayake
et al., 2021a; Accenture Security, 2020). This apparent contradiction highlights the
depth of the problem. According to a 2020 industry report, over 50% of organiza-
tions fail to apply patches for critical vulnerabilities within the recommended 72
hours, and around 15% remain unpatched even after 30 days (Automox, 2020).
Delays in applying patches have consequences that go far beyond theoretical risks:
The Equifax case (2017): One of the most serious data breaches in history
was caused by the failure to patch a known vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) in the
Apache Struts framework. The patch had been available for two months when
attackers exploited the vulnerability, exposing the personal data of 143 million
American citizens. The former CEO attributed the breach to “a single person who
failed to deploy the patch,” highlighting how a single point of failure can have
catastrophic consequences.
Ransomware attack on German hospital (2020): A cyberattack on a uni-
versity hospital in Germany resulted in the death of a patient who had to be

transferred to another facility due to system unavailability. The attack exploited a
vulnerability for which a patch was already available, demonstrating how delays in
patching can have lethal consequences in the healthcare sector.
2.2 The Challenges of Security Patch Manage-
ment
A fundamental challenge in Security Patch Management arises from the inherent
conflict between security and availability. Applying patches often requires system
reboots or service restarts, which result in temporary service interruptions. In
mission critical environments such as hospitals, critical infrastructure, or financial
services, even brief outages can have severe operational and societal consequences.
Dissanayake et al. (2021b) document how professionals are constantly required to
balance the risk of leaving vulnerabilities unpatched against the risk of disrupting
critical services. At the core of this issue lies a structural tension: security teams
are incentivized to minimize breach risk through timely patching, operational teams
prioritize service continuity, and business stakeholders seek to maximize overall
system availability. This tension cannot be resolved through technological solutions
alone; it requires effective governance, clearly defined decision making processes,
and an organizational culture capable of balancing these competing objectives.
Tiefenau et al. (2020) further highlight how practitioners often face conflicting
compliance requirements: on the one hand, security standards mandate timely
patch deployment, while on the other, service level agreements (SLAs) impose
penalties for unplanned downtime. At the same time, the rapid growth in both
the number and diversity of cyberattacks has led to an accelerated pace of patch
releases, significantly increasing the operational burden on IT teams (Dissanayake
et al., 2021a). Several key factors contribute to this challenge:
• Heterogeneity: Modern organizations operate highly heterogeneous environ-
ments, including multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS),
numerous versions of each, and hundreds of distinct software applications. As
one study participant noted: “We have about 15/16 versions of Windows 10.
Before patching, we have to identify which version is running on which server,
check the build number, and verify whether it is up to date. It’s a lot!”
• Growing volume: The number of disclosed vulnerabilities and released
patches continues to increase year after year. Practitioners frequently describe
the situation as unmanageable: “There’s just too much to check. We’re
managing 1,500 servers, and we simply do not have the time to review every
patch for every system.”

Background on Patch Management
• Extended attack surface: Large and geographically distributed organiza-
tions, hybrid and multi cloud architectures, and remote work models signi-
ficantly expand the attack surface, further complicating patch management
activities.
The limitations of existing tools represent another major obstacle to achieving effec-
tive Security Patch Management (Dissanayake et al., 2021a). The most significant
shortcomings include:
• Lack of standardization: There is no unified platform capable of integra-
ting the heterogeneous tools used across the different stages of the patch
management process.
• Accuracy issues: Many tools fail to account for the dynamic organizational
context, resulting in false positives or, conversely, in the failure to identify real
vulnerabilities.
• Scalability limitations: A large portion of available tools is not designed to
operate efficiently in large scale enterprise environments.
• Dependency management limitations: Existing solutions often focus on
individual components in isolation, without adequately considering complex
interdependencies between systems and software modules.
Due to this increasing complexity and the limitations of current technologies,
human intervention remains unavoidable throughout the patch management lifecycle
(Dissanayake et al., 2021a). As observed by Maurer and Brumley (2012): “Because
patches can change the semantics of a program, a human will probably always
need to be in the loop to determine whether semantic changes are meaningful.”
However, human involvement inevitably introduces latency: decision making takes
time, inter team communication introduces delays, and approval workflows further
slow the process. Each manual step therefore represents a potential source of delay
that extends the window of exposure.
The risk of such delays is further exacerbated by structural resource constraints,
including a shortage of specialized skills in the labor market, the absence of well
documented guidelines and standardized processes, and insufficient automation
due to limited investment or lack of expertise.
2.3 Dependencies as Obstacles
Interdependencies among software, hardware, and firmware introduce additional
layers of complexity that significantly complicate the patching process (Dissanayake
et al., 2021b):
8
Background on Patch Management
• Dependencies between operating systems and applications: Patches
applied to the operating system may impact the functionality or compatibility
of installed applications, and conversely, application updates may rely on
specific operating system versions.
• Circular dependencies: Situations in which system A depends on system
B, while system B simultaneously depends on system A, potentially leading
to operational deadlocks.
• Installation prerequisites: Some patches require prior registry modifica-
tions, the installation of prerequisite packages, or the application of specific
configuration settings.
• Dependencies with legacy systems: Many mission critical systems operate
on outdated or unsupported software versions, creating rigid dependencies
that prevent other interconnected components from being updated.
In addition to purely technical dependencies, dependencies between stakeholders
further exacerbate the challenges of Security Patch Management (Dissanayake et
al., 2021b):
• Internal dependencies: Approval workflows, communication processes, and
the coordination of maintenance windows require tight synchronization among
multiple internal teams.
• Vendor dependencies: Organizations rely on vendors for the release of
patches and must align the patch cycles of multiple suppliers and service
providers.
• Customer dependencies: Maintenance windows often need to be negotiated
with customers, who may not fully perceive or prioritize the security benefits
of patch deployment.
Security Patch Management is inherently a socio technical endeavor, characteri-
zed by the close coupling of human and technological factors. As a result, several
organizational challenges emerge:
• Administrative overhead: Coordinating stakeholders with divergent or
conflicting interests requires substantial managerial effort.
• Delegation issues: The absence of clearly defined roles and accountability
mechanisms can result in situations where responsibility for patching is diffuse
or entirely unclaimed.
9
Background on Patch Management
• Conflicts of interest: Security teams typically advocate for immediate patch
deployment, whereas operational teams may resist changes to avoid service
disruptions.
• Lack of visibility: Undocumented assets, shadow IT, and non standard
configurations create blind spots that hinder effective patch identification and
deployment.
• Fragmentation of responsibilities: In large and complex organizations,
responsibilities are often distributed across multiple teams, increasing the risk
that certain patches fall through organizational gaps.
