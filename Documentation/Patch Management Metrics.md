In today’s fast-paced world, it’s no more about keeping devices up-to-date; it’s about strengthening defenses and ensuring your prevention strategy is strong. As cyberattacks continue to evolve, measuring the success of your patch management process becomes more vital than ever.

Patch management is a process of remediating security risks once it’s detected and having a better insight into your network. But, in the chaos of managing infinite risks, you might often forget to measure the effectiveness of your patching efforts. Having patch management metrics to continuously evaluate and enhance the organization’s security posture is important.
### Patch Management Metrics 
When it comes to measuring the success of your patch management strategy, there are many KPIs you can compare with. But here are my top 7 patch management metric recommendations:

1. **Patch Coverage Rate:** This metric assesses the percentage of devices within your organization network that have received the latest patches. A high patch coverage rate indicates robust patch deployment practices, reducing the potential loopholes leading to a cyberattack. 

2. **Patch Compliance Rate:** This metric measures the percentage of devices compliant with the organization’s patching policies and timelines. It reflects the adherence to security protocols and helps identify areas requiring improvement. 
  
3. **Patch Deployment Speed:** This metric evaluates the time taken to deploy patches after their release. Faster deployment speeds reduce the window of vulnerability or exposure and keep your IT environment secure.   

4. **Patch Latency:** Patch latency measures the time between patch availability and deployment on individual systems. It is always advised to remediate a risk as soon as the patch becomes available. Lower latency signifies an efficient patch management process and timely protection against emerging threats.   

5. **Patch Success Rate:** This metric gauges the percentage of patches that are successfully deployed without causing system disruptions, compatibility issues, and disturbing operational hours. A high success rate indicates effective patch testing and deployment procedures.   
  
6. **Patch Rollback Rate:** In cases where patches cause system errors or issues, the patch rollback rate measures the percentage of patches that are rolled back or reverted. Alongside, monitoring this metric helps identify problematic patches and refine the testing process.   
  
7. **Vulnerability Reoccurrence Rate:** This metric assesses the frequency at which previously patched vulnerabilities resurface. When we’ve applied a patch to fix a vulnerability, it’s crucial that it doesn’t show up again under any circumstances. A high reoccurrence rate could signal either poor patch management practices or ongoing security weaknesses.
## Conclusion 

By tracking the above patch management metrics, organizations can proactively identify vulnerabilities, improve their patch management strategy, and enhance the organization’s overall cybersecurity. 

Why Track These KPIs?

- **Measure Effectiveness:** Quantify how well your patching process works.
- **Identify Weaknesses:** Pinpoint bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- **Reduce Risk:** Faster patching minimizes window for exploitation (especially for zero-days).
- **Ensure Compliance:** Prove adherence to internal policies and regulations.
- **Improve Stability:** High success and low rollback rates mean fewer disruptions. 

By tracking these KPIs, organizations can continuously refine their patch management to stay ahead of threats and maintain a healthy IT environment.

Patch management is an essential part of maintaining secure IT environments. It addresses vulnerabilities, keeps devices up-to-date with the latest security and performance improvements, and helps ensure IT compliance. Yet all too often, businesses neglect their patch management metrics and fail to monitor their patches.

Tracking [patch management](https://www.splashtop.com/blog/what-is-patch-management) metrics and KPIs is a useful way for IT teams to optimize their patching processes, improve security, and ensure compliance with all relevant standards and regulations. So with that in mind, let’s examine the key metrics for effective patch management, why they matter, and how solutions like Splashtop AEM make it easy to monitor these metrics.

**Why Tracking Metrics & KPIs Is Crucial for Patch Management**

You might be wondering: “Why is tracking patch management KPIs so important?” It’s easy to think that patch management is a simple matter of installing updates and moving on, but it’s actually an important process that can impact efficiency and productivity across an organization. After all, if patches take too long to install or encounter unexpected compatibility issues, it could cost employees time and cause unforeseen downtime. Skipping patch updates, meanwhile, leads to [cybersecurity](https://www.splashtop.com/blog/what-is-cybersecurity) risks.

Patch management metrics provide essential insights into the effectiveness of the patching process. This helps organizations stay productive, mitigate vulnerabilities, and improve their overall security, while guiding IT teams to make informed decisions when installing patches.

For instance, some key metrics for effective patch management include the time it takes to detect and install patches (the average time to remediation). Understanding these KPIs helps IT teams ensure their patch management process is efficient and enables them to address vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. This data-driven approach helps teams improve their patching processes and reduce the risk of data breaches, which is vital for security and IT compliance.

## 

**Top 10 Patch Management Metrics to Monitor**

With that in mind, it’s time to look at the key patch management metrics you’ll want to monitor. These KPIs will provide valuable insights into your patch deployment process, areas where it can and should be improved, and obstacles you’ll want to avoid.

Patch management KPIs to monitor include:

### 1. **Patch Deployment Frequency**

First, consider the frequency and regularity of your patch deployments (also known as the patching cadence). A good patching frequency helps ensure you’re keeping up with new patches, thus reducing the time your endpoints and systems spend unpatched and vulnerable.

### 2. **Patch Response Time**

How quickly are you patching your endpoints? It’s essential to track the time it takes to patch, from the moment the vulnerability is discovered to the deployment of the patch. This helps determine how quick and responsive your company’s patch management process is. A quick response time indicates effective patch management and risk mitigation, but a slower time is a sign that it needs improvement.

### 3. **Percentage of Systems Patched**

When you patch your endpoints, you must ensure every device is covered; leaving any devices or systems unpatched creates massive vulnerabilities that cyberattackers can exploit. As such, it helps to track the percentage of systems patched to gain a full view of patch coverage across your IT infrastructure. This provides a clear indication of how thorough your patch management process is and can identify any endpoints that still require updates.

### 4. **Number of Failed Patch Applications**

Occasionally, patches don’t get installed properly and need to be reinstalled. However, if that happens frequently, it could be a sign of problems that must be addressed. Tracking the number of failed patches can identify issues with the patch management process, so IT teams can address them and improve the process. This helps maintain full patch coverage across an organization and boosts patching efficiency.

### 5. **Track Re-Patched Vulnerabilities**

There are times when vulnerabilities that have been patched once need to be patched again. Tracking these instances helps understand how effective your initial patching efforts are and identify areas for improvement for your patch testing and deployment.

### 6. **Compliance with Patch Standards**

Keeping endpoints and systems fully updated and patched is an important requirement for IT compliance. Tracking your patch compliance rate metric indicates how well you’re maintaining your security in compliance with these guidelines, so you can demonstrate you’re meeting your compliance standards and following best practices.

### 7. **Track Critical Vulnerability Patches**

Some vulnerabilities are more dangerous than others, and it’s critical to patch these high-priority vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. Tracking your critical vulnerabilities patched can show how well you’re addressing severe prompts quickly and can help guide your vulnerability management efforts.

### 8. **User Device Patch Compliance**

Patch management is a shared responsibility – users must do their part by installing updates when they become available, rather than constantly clicking “remind me later.” Tracking your end-user patch compliance shows how successful your policies are at keeping endpoints updated and helps ensure full, comprehensive security coverage.

### 9. **Success Rate of Patch Testing**

When you begin installing patches, you need to test them to ensure they work properly on your devices and don’t cause any unexpected issues. Tracking the success rate of these patches helps ensure that you’ll be able to deploy them properly across a wider environment or identify issues that need to be addressed before the patches are installed elsewhere.

### 10. **Instances of Patch Rollbacks**

If patching goes wrong and you need to roll it back, it could be a sign of underlying issues that your IT team should address. Measuring how often you have to roll back patches provides important insights into the stability of your patches and helps identify potential issues within your IT environment.

## 

**How Can Key Metrics Be Integrated into Patch Management Strategies?**

It’s clear that several important KPIs can provide valuable insights into patch management and security compliance. As such, tracking patch management metrics should be part of your overall security strategies.

Patch management KPIs help you identify weaknesses and areas for improvement in your patch management process, so you can refine the process and provide more thorough coverage. This constant assessment is key to maintaining a fully updated endpoint environment and ensuring your patch management process follows best practices.

Additionally, these metrics can help provide important data for your overall security posture. For instance, integrating patch management and vulnerability management metrics provides a more complete view of your security, so you can meet your compliance requirements and ensure thorough security across your organization.

**From Manual Fixes to Automated Security: The Evolution of Patching**

Patch management used to be a time-consuming manual process with little visibility into its progress. Fortunately, that’s no longer the case. Today, automated [patch management solutions](https://www.splashtop.com/solutions/patch-management) make it easy to patch endpoints, operating systems, and applications across remote environments from a single place.

When organizations rely on manual patching, they need IT agents to constantly check for updates, then go to each device, start the patch installation, and then wait to make sure it’s properly installed and error-free. This is a slow, repetitive process that wastes time and resources, and it’s prone to human error.

However, with a solution like [Splashtop AEM](https://www.splashtop.com/add-ons/endpoint-management) (Autonomous Endpoint Management), you can automatically detect new patches, test and deploy them across devices, and ensure each patch is properly installed without needing manual intervention. This saves time, eliminates human error, and provides efficient patch rollouts across all endpoints.
